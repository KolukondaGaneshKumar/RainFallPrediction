## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The `weatherAUS.csv` dataset contains weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, from several locations across Australia. 

This prediction can help make better agricultural and logistical decisions by forecasting rainfall.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `weatherAUS.csv`, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).

### Key Features:
- **Location**: The location where the observation was recorded.
- **MinTemp**: Minimum temperature in degrees Celsius.
- **MaxTemp**: Maximum temperature in degrees Celsius.
- **Rainfall**: Amount of rainfall recorded in mm.
- **Humidity3pm**: Humidity at 3 PM.
- **RainToday**: Whether it rained today (Yes/No).
- **RainTomorrow**: Target variable indicating whether it will rain tomorrow (Yes/No).

## Modeling Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze relationships between features and visualize the data.
3. **Modeling**: Train different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Optimization**: Use techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for improving model performance.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of around 86% on the test dataset. The final model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves. Key insights from the data include the importance of features such as humidity, temperature, and wind speed in predicting rainfall.
